CS180 Project

R’Insight is a housing review application designed specifically for UCR students, offering a comprehensive platform to explore on-campus housing options through an interactive map. The core of the application lies in its user-centric approach, providing a detailed view of dorms and apartments, enabling students to make informed decisions based on peer reviews. With an emphasis on community insights, the application features a robust review system where students can rate housing based on cost, location, accessibility, and comfortability, using a 1 to 5-star system across these predefined categories.

The application is developed using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface. It integrates advanced mapping technologies, like Google Maps API, to visualize campus housing options accurately. The backend, supported by MongoDB, manages review data, ensuring real-time updates and interactions. A significant focus is also placed on content moderation and review validation. R’Insight strives to maintain the integrity and reliability of user-generated content.
To enhance user experience, the application incorporates UI/UX design principles, utilizing libraries such as Material-UI for an intuitive and engaging interface. The project prioritizes accessibility and usability, making it an invaluable tool for UCR students navigating their housing options. This application not only simplifies the search for suitable on-campus housing but also fosters a sense of community by sharing honest reviews and ratings.
